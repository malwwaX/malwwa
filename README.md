in order for it to work download setup.bat, setup.py and on releases the malwwa.exe.
then put all those files together in one folder.


before using this you agree to the tos of our discord server.



FIRST open setup.bat this is a shortcut to open setup.py.
setup.py asks you for you're user id from discord you need this correct for this to work with your discord account.
then it creates a .json file with your user id in, you always need malwwa.exe and the .json file together in the same folder for this to work.
now you can open the malwwa.exe .

once it works you can check the server "https://discord.gg/rYF5DFcfY2" with the account you put the user id on and look for you're pc name.

NOTE: only the user id you gave can check the channels no one else can.
